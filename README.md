# Introduction

The TokenD web-client is written on [Vue v2](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)

# How to
## Run the project

1. Install node.js (Go to [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the help)
2. Install git (Go to [git install instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for the help)
3. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tokend/client-scaffold.git`
4. In project folder, execute: `npm install`
5. [Configure your instance](#configure-instance)
6. To start project on local server the development mode, execute: `npm run dev`
7. Open http://localhost:8095 in browser.

To stop local server, press `Ctrl + C` in terminal.

If the remote repository was updated, you need to execute `git pull` command on your local machine to get the updates. To restart the project, repeat step 4 and 5 of this instruction.

## Configure your instance
All the environment files are located in `config` directory. You have to edit one of them
to change the hostnames of `horizon`, `api` and `storage` servers and `network_passphrase`
- `dev-local.env.js` is used for the local built instances
- `prod.env.js` is used for the instances built for production
- `default.env.js` contains default configuration of the application and may be included
  and merged into other `.env` files

To run the application in local development mode, run `npm run dev`  
To build the application for production, run `npm run build.prod`

## Customize Crowdsale

### Changes to the model

Navigate to `/src/vue/app/saleCreation/`. Your journey starts from `SaleCreation.Index.vue`.

To update the crowdsale model, you can modify the object passed to `salesService.createSaleCreationRequest` call. You cannot change anything but `details` property, otherwise back-end will reject your request.

### Changes to views

Crowdsale is shown on following pages:
- Crowdsale creation page (`src/vue/app/saleCreation`)
- Crowdsale creation requests page
(`src/vue/app/requests/index/Requests.SaleCreation.vue`)
- Crowdsale list page
(`src/vue/app/sales`)
- Crowdsale details page(`src/vue/app/sales/sale_details/Sales.Details.vue`)

Also on admin panel:
- Crowdsale list page (`src/components/User/Sales/Sales.Index.vue`)
- Crowdsale details page(`src/components/User/Sales/Sales.Show.vue`)
- Crowdsale requests page
(`src/components/User/Sales/SaleRequests`)

Any changes to crowdsale model should be done alongside with changes to the views mentioned above. The trickiest part is adding fields to crowdsale creation page.

In `SaleCreation.Index.vue` file you can see usage of `md-steppers` of [Vue material framework](https://vuematerial.io/) in combination with so-called schemas. To modify set of fields on a step, you can edit the appropriate `.schema.js` file located in `/src/vue/app/saleCreation/specs/` directory.

Currently, there are three steps:
- General info
- Image and short description
- Video and long description

Schema defines the set of fields only. Actual component markup is taken from `/src/vue/app/saleCreation/steps/` directory. Schema files contain references to the component used on each step.

How are schemas work with the components (`SaleCreation.Index`):
```
  <template v-else-if="view.mode === VIEW_MODES.edit">
    <md-steppers class="create-sale__steppers"
                  md-vertical
                  md-linear
                  :md-active-step.sync="activeStep">
      <md-step v-for="(step, i) in steps"
              :key="i"
              :id="step.name"
              :md-label="step.label"
              :md-done.sync="step.done"
      >
        <component :is="step.component"
                  :schema="step.schema"
                  :sale="sale"
                  @sale-update="handleSaleUpdate($event, { step, i })"
                  @sale-edit-end="handleSaleEditEnd"
        />
      </md-step>
    </md-steppers>
  </template>
```

Component applied with `:is` attribute in the `<component>`. Component from `step.component` will take `:schema` as the prop. Implementations of all used components are located in `/src/vue/app/saleCreation/steps/`.

All the other actions should be familiar to developers who had experience with Vue before.
